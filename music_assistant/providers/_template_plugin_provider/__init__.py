"""
DEMO/TEMPLATE Plugin Provider for Music Assistant.

This is an empty plugin provider with no actual implementation.
Its meant to get started developing a new plugin provider for Music Assistant.

Use it as a reference to discover what methods exists and what they should return.
Also it is good to look at existing plugin providers to get a better understanding.

In general, a plugin provider does not have any mandatory implementation details.
It provides additional functionality to Music Assistant and most often it will
interact with the existing core controllers and event logic. For example a Scrobble plugin.

If your plugin needs to communicate with external services or devices, you need to
use a dedicated (async) library for that. You can add these dependencies to the
manifest.json file in the requirements section,
which is a list of (versioned!) python modules (pip syntax) that should be installed
when the provider is selected by the user.

To add a new plugin provider to Music Assistant, you need to create a new folder
in the providers folder with the name of your provider (e.g. 'my_plugin_provider').
In that folder you should create (at least) a __init__.py file and a manifest.json file.

Optional is an icon.svg file that will be used as the icon for the provider in the UI,
but we also support that you specify a material design icon in the manifest.json file.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
We strongly recommend developing on either MacOS or Linux and start your development
environment by running the setup.sh scripts in the scripts folder of the repository.
This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies needed for development.
See also our general DEVELOPMENT.md guide in the repository for more information.
